# React Native
React Native is an open source JavaScript library based on react that is used to build cross platform native mobile apps. React Native is truly a cross platform mobile library which you can build native iOS, android, Windows and TV apps using JavaScript and react.

React Native is written in JavaScript but renders or generates native code. Although the code is in JavaSciprt, it renders to work with the devices's processors. React components wrap the existing native mobile code and interact with native APIs.
